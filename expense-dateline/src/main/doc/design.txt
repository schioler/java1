Description:
- Compare your actual expenses with your budget as you go along.
   For a given period, see how much has been spent
   Compare it with the budget figures for each account
- Determine how much is actually needed each month/day/.. based on actual figures.
   Based on actual expenses in a period, determine usage pr month grouped by account.
   For the decided timeperiod (src accounts), total expense/account should be calculated and divided with the number of days in the period. Also number of months
   Output:
      account tree with total, avg pr mnth, avg pr day.
- Evaluate how much I spend for accounts
      Could be a graph, showing the distribution, i.e. when the expenses actually take place.

- What is the minimum avg amount that is required?
- Get in a better touch with the money you spend.
- handle multiple users.

- Storage
Data is kept in database, handled by persistancemanager
unique key: date+text+amount. Hopefully managed by database
- Input:
   Any file with accounting/transaction lines

- Data:
-- Stamdata:
text to account map.

-- Linedata
Handled in internal format:
ID
USER
EXP_CATEGORY
EXP_GROUP
EXP_ACCOUNT
DATE
TEXT
AMOUNT

- Motor:
-- do INPUT data:
reads inputfile, maps to internal format, determines category/group/account from text comparison, insert into database.
if CGA not found: skipped and put in errorfile.
Must be re-entrant -> run same file as many times as desired

-- REPORT:
Usecase:
1: Avg Category Expenses for the timeperiod, in specified intervals
   how much money have I used on housing/car/.. each month in the last year?
2: Avg Group Expenses for the timeperiod, in specified intervals
   how much money have I used on housing.loan/car.gas/.. each day in the last year?
3: Custom report
   Specify what CGA numbers to include in report.

Output:
Text overview 1
      int1  int2  int3  int3 ...
cat1   $v    $v    $v    $v
cat2   $v    $v    $v    $v

Text overview 2
           int1  int2  int3  int3 ...
cat1        $v    $v    $v    $v
cat1.grp1   $v    $v    $v    $v
cat1.grp2   $v    $v    $v    $v
cat2        $v    $v    $v    $v


handle one report at a time
Note:
      1: build the timeline in specified intervals
      2: select/run through all expense entries in the period, add it to the interval.
      3: generate the output for the interval: avg/max/min/..
